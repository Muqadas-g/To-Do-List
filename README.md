# üöÄ Professional To-Do List Web Application

A modern, responsive, and intuitive web-based To-Do List application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks with a focus on user experience and data persistence.



## ‚ú® Features

This To-Do List application comes packed with the following functionalities:

* **Add New Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your list using a sleek input field.
* **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Toggle tasks as complete or incomplete with a simple click on the checkbox. Completed tasks are visually distinguished (strikethrough and light green background).
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove unwanted tasks permanently with a clear delete icon and confirmation prompt.
* **Edit Existing Tasks (Inline Editing):** Directly click on the task text or the edit icon to make it editable. Changes are saved automatically when you press `Enter` or click away from the text.
* **Dynamic Task Count:** Displays a real-time count of total tasks and completed tasks at the bottom of the list.
* **Filter Tasks:** Manage your task view with filter tabs:
    * **All:** Shows all tasks, regardless of their completion status.
    * **Pending:** Displays only incomplete tasks.
    * **Completed:** Shows only tasks that have been marked as finished.
* **Data Persistence:** All tasks are automatically saved to your browser's **Local Storage**. This ensures your data remains intact even after closing and reopening the browser or navigating away from the page.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly across various devices, from desktops and laptops to tablets and mobile phones. The layout adjusts to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience on any screen size.
* **Professional UI/UX & Visual Feedback:**
    * **Clean and Modern Design:** Utilizes a subtle gradient background, prominent shadows, and a clean layout for a polished look.
    * **Typography:** Employs **Google Fonts** (`Roboto`) for enhanced readability and a contemporary feel.
    * **Interactive Icons:** Uses **Font Awesome icons** for actions (Add, Edit, Delete) for better visual clarity and an intuitive interface.
    * **Smooth Transitions and Animations:** Features subtle hover effects on buttons and task items, smooth transform transitions, and a fade-in animation for the main container and individual tasks upon loading/addition, enhancing the overall interactivity.
    * **Clear State Indicators:** Filter buttons clearly indicate the active filter.
    * **Input Feedback:** The input field automatically regains focus after a task is added, and provides a visual "shake" animation with a red border if an attempt is made to add an empty task.
    * **Empty State Messages:** Displays informative and friendly messages when the task list is empty or when no tasks match the current filter.
